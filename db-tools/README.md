The `devmine-features` repository shares the database schemas with
[devmine-core](https://github.com/DevMine/devmine-core). To create the database
schemas, just start the `devmine-core` server once. Keep in mind that all
schemas are defined in `devmine-core/devmine/app/models` before doing any
changes to the script that inserts data into the database.
